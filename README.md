Arduino Project - Touchscreen Temperature & Humidity Controller 
See video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SfpYZhzmHI

For touchscreen applications it is recommended to use 1 Arduino for touch display and 1 Arduino for data acquisition and process control. Data transfer between Arduino's should be through serial port.

In this project I used :
- 1 Arduino Mega;
- 1 2,4" LCD TFT Touchscreen display;
- 1 DHT 11.
You can find library and library examples in the archive.
